# Challenge 1: Yield Curve inversion

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explainer what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).


```{r yield_curve_parable.jpg, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_parable.jpg"), error = FALSE)
```


In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. If you want to know more, a very nice article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). At the end of this challenge you should produce this chart

```{r yield_curve_challenge, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve_challenge.png"), error = FALSE)
```


First, we will use the `tidyquant` package to download monthly rates for different durations. 

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)

# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960

glimpse(df)
```

Our dataframe `df` has three columns (variables):

- `symbol`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `date`: already a date object
- `price`: the actual yield on that date

The first thing would be to join this dataframe `df` with the dataframe `mylookup` so we have a more readable version of maturities, durations, etc.


```{r join_data, warning=FALSE}

yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol") 
```

## Plotting the yield curve

This may seem long but it should be easy to produce the following three plots

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve1.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, yield_curve_1.1, fig1, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

yield_curve$var_f = factor(yield_curve$var, levels=c('3-Month Treasury Bill', '6-Month Treasury Bill', '1-Year Treasury Rate', '2-Year Treasury Rate','3-Year Treasury Rate','5-Year Treasury Rate','7-Year Treasury Rate','10-Year Treasury Rate','20-Year Treasury Rate','30-Year Treasury Rate'))

ggplot(yield_curve, aes(x=date, y=price, color=symbol)) +
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~var_f, ncol=2)+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none",
         axis.title.x=element_blank(),
         axis.title.y=element_blank()
        )+
  labs(
    title = "Yields on U.S. Treasury Rates since 1960",
    caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)"
  )

```



### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis


```{r yield_curve_2, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve2.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r, yield_curve_1.2, fig1, fig.width=8, fig.height=6}

yield_curve_1998 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(ymd(date))) %>%
  filter(year > 1998) %>%
  mutate(month = month(ymd(date)))

ggplot(yield_curve_1998, aes(x=maturity, y=price))+
  facet_wrap(~year,ncol = 4)+
  geom_line(aes(group = month, color=factor(year)))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(title="U.S. Yield Curve", x="Maturity", y="Yield (%)", caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)")

```

### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r yield_curve_3, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "yield_curve3.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}

yield_curve_3_10 <- yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(ymd(date))) %>%
  filter(year > 1998) %>%
  filter(var_f %in% c("3-Month Treasury Bill","10-Year Treasury Rate"))
  

ggplot(yield_curve_3_10, aes(x=date, y=price))+
  geom_line(aes(color=var_f))+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "right", legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title="Yields on 3-month and 10-year US Treasury rates since 1999", x="", y="%")

```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. Does the yield curve seem to flatten before these recessions? Can a yield curve flattening really mean a recession is coming in the US? Since 1999, when did short-term (3 months) yield more than longer term (10 years) debt?



Besides calculating the spread (10year - 3months), there are a few things we need to do to produce our final plot

1. Setup data for US recessions 
1. Superimpose recessions as the grey areas in our plot
1. Plot the spread between 30 years and 3 months as a blue/red ribbon, based on whether the spread is positive (blue) or negative(red)


- For the first, the code below creates a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

- To add the grey shaded areas corresponding to recessions, we use `geom_rect()`
- to colour the ribbons blue/red we must see whether the spread is positive or negative and then use `geom_ribbon()`. You should be familiar with this from last week's homework on the excess weekly/monthly rentals of Santander Bikes in London.

```{r}
library(scales)

# Challenge 2:GDP components over time and among countries

At the risk of oversimplifying things, the main components of gross domestic product, GDP are personal consumption (C), business investment (I), government spending (G) and net exports (exports - imports). You can read more about GDP and the different approaches in calculating at the [Wikipedia GDP page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product).

The GDP data we will look at is from the [United Nations' National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Downloads), which contains estimates of total GDP and its components for all countries from 1970 to today. We will look at how GDP and its components have changed over time, and compare different countries and how much each component contributes to that country's GDP. The file we will work with is [GDP and its breakdown at constant 2010 prices in US Dollars](http://unstats.un.org/unsd/amaapi/api/file/6) and it has already been saved in the Data directory. Have a look at the Excel file to see how it is structured and organised


```{r read_GDP_data}

UN_GDP_data  <-  read_excel(here::here("data", "Download-GDPconstant-USD-countries.xls"), # Excel filename
                sheet="Download-GDPconstant-USD-countr", # Sheet name
                skip=2) # Number of rows to skip

```

The first thing you need to do is to tidy the data, as it is in wide format and you must make it into long, tidy format. Please express all figures in billions (divide values by `1e9`, or $10^9$), and you want to rename the indicators into something shorter.

> make sure you remove `eval=FALSE` from the next chunk of R code-- I have it there so I could knit the document

```{r reshape_GDP_data}

tidy_GDP_data  <-  UN_GDP_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(
               cols="1970":"2017",
               names_to = "year", 
               values_to= "value"
               ) %>% 
  mutate(year= as.Date(year, "%Y"))

glimpse(tidy_GDP_data)

# Let us compare GDP components for these 3 countries
country_list <- c("United States","India", "Germany")
```

First, can you produce this plot?


```{r gdp1, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "gdp1.png"), error = FALSE)
```


Secondly, recall that GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator `Gross Domestic Product (GDP)` in your dataframe, I would like you to calculate it given its components discussed above.



```{r, GDP_Components_Over_Time, fig1, fig.width=10, fig.height=6}

gdp_time <- tidy_GDP_data %>% 
  #filtering for the components of GDP and countries that we need
  filter(Country %in% country_list,

                              "Exports of goods and services",
                              "General government final consumption expenditure")) %>%

> What is this last chart telling you? Can you explain in a couple of paragraphs the different dynamic among these three countries? 

This last chart compares the change in the proportion of the various components of GDP over time for three countries (United States, India and Germany). Since the early 2000s, Germany has increased the proportion of its GDP from Net Exports (Exports-Imports) and now has one of the highest trade surpluses in the world - this is an indicator of economic strength and competitiveness. 

In India proportion of GDP from Household Expenditure has decreased sharply while there has been a sharp increase in the proportion of its GDP from Gross Capital Formation - this shows that the economy is growing quickly and investing in fixed asset (roads, railways, machinery, etc.) 

Lastly, in the United States the proportion of GDP from Household Expenditure has increased while the Net Exports decreased, implying that US is slightly relying more on imports of goods. Also,  proportion of GDP from government expenditure has been slowly decreasing since 1970, indicating the reduced size of US government and its fiscal decentralization approach in the country.
